🏁 Burnout 2025: MotoGP Lap Time Prediction

Welcome to our submission for the **Burnout 2025: MotoGP Data Analytics Challenge**, organized by IEEE Computer Society MUJ. This project focuses on predicting average lap times (`Lap_Time_Seconds`) for MotoGP riders using machine learning and ensemble modeling techniques.

---

📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this competition is to predict a rider’s average lap time in seconds for a given MotoGP session, based on historical and session-level race features. The challenge emphasizes:

- Accuracy of prediction using RMSE.
- Intelligent handling of real-world data irregularities like DNS (Did Not Start) and DNF (Did Not Finish) entries.
- Interpretability and reproducibility.

## 🧠 Approach

Our solution follows a systematic data science pipeline:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Detected missing values and analyzed feature distributions.
- Found important correlations between lap time and variables like `Grid_Position`, `Avg_Speed_kmh`, `Circuit_Length_km`, etc.
- DNS/DNF entries were **retained** and treated as valid (e.g., practice/qualifying data).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.
- Created interaction terms and polynomial combinations.
- Normalized skewed continuous features.
- Retained relevant metadata like `Bike`, `Team`, `Rider`, and `Circuit`.

### 3. Model Building
Used a stacked ensemble of three powerful regressors:
- **LightGBM** – Fast, leaf-wise boosting model.
- **CatBoost** – Handles categorical features natively and robust to overfitting.
- **XGBoost** – Effective gradient boosting decision tree model.
- **Ridge Regression** – Blends tree-based predictions for improved generalization.

### 4. Evaluation
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used as the metric:
- Final **Validation RMSE**: `4.3718`
- DNS/DNF entries were preserved with proper justification (e.g., reflect non-race performance such as qualifying).

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:

* train.csv – Training set with lap time labels.
* test.csv – Test set to predict.
* sample_submission.csv` – Format reference.
* val.csv – Optional validation set.

Target variable: `Lap_Time_Seconds`
## 🔬 Results & Insights

* **Stacking** significantly reduced overfitting.
* CatBoost performed best individually.
* Final model ensemble gave robust results with low RMSE even on edge cases like DNS/DNF.
* Retaining DNS/DNF helped maintain data richness and generalization

## 📤 Output

* `solution.csv` with `Unique ID` and predicted `Lap_Time_Seconds`.
* Final model achieves **RMSE: \~4.37**, targeting further tuning toward `RMSE ≤ 3`.
## 📌 Notes

* This repository adheres to all Burnout 2025 competition rules.
* Code is fully reproducible and avoids data leakage.
* Plagiarism-free, clean implementation.
